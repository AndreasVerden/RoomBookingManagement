# Room Booking Management
This was supposed to be a simple school project to learn about Remote Method Invocation (RMI) so I up made my own challenge. My goal was to implement a more complex variant with proper business logic in the most elegant way I could come up with. At the time I was reading the book Domain-Driven Design (DDD) by Eric Evans and I wanted to try out what I've learned.

Most of the development time was focused on the relative perfection of the Domain Model. This was so successful, that implementing other parts like the UI could be done in mare minutes! This experience is at the core of my support for the DDD approach.

## Status
The source code was rescued from an old back up I recently found ling around. Back when I was working on this project I didn't use git or any version control system so progress was not tracked. Also I'm pretty sure that this isn't the version I handed in, for one because there is not even a trace of a UI...
I didn't try to run nor test the code ether. 
I have no plans to continue working on this project since it does not provide any useful functionality. 
The reason I uploaded this is simply to archive this code base for good. And maybe for future reference.
